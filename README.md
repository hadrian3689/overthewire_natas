# OverTheWire Natas Web Challenges
This is my journey and personal challenge of finishing the Natas web series from Over The Wire. The goal here is to let the script do as much of the work as possible.

## Usage
```
for i in $(ls -1v | grep -i '.py'); do python3 $i; done
```

## Disclaimer
I am not a programmer, or developer, in any way. So if you think my code and implementation is bad, then you are probably right.
